2.) The expected number of AAA would be 1/(4^3) * 1,000 or 1,000/64, which is 15.625. Since the frequency of any given nucleotide is even (.25) we can say the frequency is 1/4. The program reflects this over multiple runs.

3.) I modified the code to accept probabilities for any given nucleotide. Since the probability of getting an A nucleotide is lower, the total number of AAA 3mers is lower. It will be slightly less than 2 at 1.728, since 1000 * (12/100)^3. The Java code reflects this.

I'll be working on the last portion of the extra credit to see if I can complete it by Friday.
